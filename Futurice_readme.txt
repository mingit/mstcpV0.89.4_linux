Hei Futurice recruiting team,

This is one of my programming work I want to show to you. I designed and implemented a Multi-path Single-flow TCP in Linux kernel.

My codes are in many files of two folders net/mptcp and net/ipv4. I did not implement all the TCP functions. Instead, I make it based
on the codes of MPTCP.
